## 🚀 Example Code

```python
# code here
# your example tuple code

# Creating an empty tuple
e = ()
print(e)
print(type(e))

# Creating a tuple
t = (5, 64, 23, 99)
print(t)
print(type(t))

# Difference: list for comparison
l = []
print(type(l))

# Tuple unpacking
person = ("John", 25, "Engineer")
name, age, profession = person

print(name)        # John
print(age)         # 25
